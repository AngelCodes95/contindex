# {{.ProjectName}} Context Index

This file was generated by contindex v{{.ContindexVersion}} on {{.GeneratedAt}}.

## Context Organization

Your context files are organized as individual chapter files. AI tools can reference this index and load specific chapters instead of processing large monolithic files.

## Available Chapter Files

(Chapter files will be listed here when you run `contindex update` or `contindex convert`)

## How to Use This Structure

1. **Place context files** in the `{{.ContextDir}}/` directory
2. **Reference specific files** in your AI tool prompts
3. **Keep this file lightweight** - it should only contain references, not content

## AI Tool Integration

Most AI tools can follow file references. Examples:

- **Claude Code**: Load specific files from {{.ContextDir}}/
- **Cursor**: Reference individual files in your prompts  
- **Copilot**: Reference specific files in comments
- **Generic**: Copy file paths into AI tool context

## File Structure
```
{{.ContextDir}}/
├── chapter-file-1.md
├── chapter-file-2.md
└── chapter-file-n.md
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive, semantic filenames for chapters
- Keep individual files focused on specific topics
- Update this file when adding new chapters (run `contindex update`)
- Files will be automatically named for optimal AI consumption

## Usage

1. Add your content files to the `{{.ContextDir}}/` directory
2. Run `contindex update` to refresh this index with current files
3. AI tools can now selectively load relevant chapters
