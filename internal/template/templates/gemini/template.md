# {{.ProjectName}} - Gemini Context Index

This GEMINI.md file serves as a table of contents for organized context chapters. Instead of processing all project context at once, Gemini should reference this index first, then request specific chapter files based on the current conversation or task.

## Available Context Chapters

(Chapter files will be listed here when you run `contindex update` or `contindex convert`)

## How Gemini Should Use This Index

1. **Reference this index first** to understand what context chapters are available
2. **Request specific chapters** by asking to "read {{.ContextDir}}/filename.md" for relevant context
3. **Process focused content** - load only chapters relevant to the current conversation

Example conversation flow with Gemini:
```
User: "Help me implement authentication"
Gemini: "Let me read the authentication context first"
Request: "Please read {{.ContextDir}}/authentication.md"
Gemini: [processes specific auth context and provides targeted help]
```

For multi-topic conversations:
```
User: "Review my API design and auth implementation"
Gemini: "I'll need to review both contexts"
Request: "Please read {{.ContextDir}}/api-design.md and {{.ContextDir}}/authentication.md"
```

## Context Chapter Structure
```
{{.ContextDir}}/
├── [semantically-named-files].md
└── (files listed above in Available Context Chapters)
```

## Contindex Workflow for Gemini

1. **Add context files** to `{{.ContextDir}}/` directory
2. **Run `contindex update`** to refresh this index with current chapters
3. **Reference this index** in conversations to see available context
4. **Request specific chapters** by asking Gemini to read relevant files
5. **Maintain conversation focus** by loading only needed context per topic

## Integration Best Practices

- **Conversation Starters**: Begin complex topics by referencing this index
- **Context Requests**: Ask Gemini to "read [specific-file]" for targeted help
- **Multi-file Tasks**: Request multiple related chapters for comprehensive discussions
- **Context Switching**: Reference this index when changing topics to identify relevant files

## Index-Chapter Benefits for Gemini
- **Focused conversations**: Only relevant context per topic improves response quality
- **Conversation efficiency**: Avoid overwhelming with entire project context
- **Organized discussions**: Structured approach to complex project topics
- **Context clarity**: Clear understanding of what information is available
- **Scalable**: Add unlimited chapters without disrupting conversation flow

## Usage Examples

**For debugging issues:**
- "Check this index, then read the relevant context files to help debug my authentication problem"

**For code reviews:**
- "Reference this index to find the API design context, then review my endpoint implementation"

**For feature planning:**
- "Look at this context index and suggest which files to review for planning the user management feature"
