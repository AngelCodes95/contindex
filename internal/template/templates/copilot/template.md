# GitHub Copilot Instructions for {{.ProjectName}}

This copilot-instructions.md file serves as a table of contents for organized context chapters. Instead of processing all project context at once, GitHub Copilot should reference this index first, then selectively load only the relevant chapter files based on the current development task.

## Available Context Chapters

(Chapter files will be listed here when you run `contindex update` or `contindex convert`)

## How GitHub Copilot Should Use This Index

1. **Reference this index first** to understand what context chapters are available
2. **Selectively open relevant chapters** as editor tabs based on current task  
3. **Process only focused context** - avoid overwhelming with entire project context

### Index-Driven Workflow

**For authentication work:**
- Open `{{.ContextDir}}/authentication.md` in editor tab
- Reference in code: `// Based on context/authentication.md - implement JWT validation`

**For database operations:**
- Open `{{.ContextDir}}/database-schema.md` in editor tab  
- Reference in code: `// Following patterns from context/database-schema.md`

**For API development:**
- Open `{{.ContextDir}}/api-design.md` in editor tab
- Reference in code: `// API patterns from context/api-design.md`

## Context Chapter Structure
```
{{.ContextDir}}/
├── [semantically-named-files].md
└── (files listed above in Available Context Chapters)
```

## Contindex Workflow for Copilot

1. **Add context files** to `{{.ContextDir}}/` directory
2. **Run `contindex update`** to refresh this index with current chapters
3. **Reference this index** to identify relevant chapters for each task
4. **Open specific chapters** as editor tabs (Copilot reads tab context)
5. **Add code comments** referencing specific chapter files for better suggestions

## Integration Best Practices

- **Tab Management**: Open only relevant chapter files as tabs per task
- **Code Comments**: Reference specific chapters: `// See context/auth.md for flow`
- **Commit Messages**: `git commit -m "feat: user auth per context/authentication.md"`
- **PR Descriptions**: Reference relevant context chapters for reviewers

## Index-Chapter Benefits for Copilot
- **Focused suggestions**: Only relevant context per task improves code quality
- **Token efficiency**: Avoid context overload - load only what's needed
- **Organized workflow**: Structured approach to context consumption
- **Team consistency**: Shared understanding through indexed chapters
- **Scalable**: Add unlimited chapters without bloating main instructions
